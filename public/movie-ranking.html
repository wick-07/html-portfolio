<h1>The Best Movies According To Akash</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Batman begins</h3>
<p>
    Firstly my favourite super hero is the Batman.the reason he being my favourite is because he does not have any superpower and is all his sills and strength that he attained with lots of training.
    He when asked about his superpower says "i am rich".The actor and director of this movie are my favourites.basically you can watch the batman trilogy cause worth watching.

<h3>The Persuit Of Happyness</h3>
<p>
    This movie is very emotional and also at the same time motivating.i liked the movie just because it shows a lots of suffering in it but still the main character of the movie do not gives up on his hope and 
    being a intelligent guy does not getting what he deserves he does not care and keeps trying to sell his idea and also handles his one another job as well just to fulfill his family requirements
</p>
<h3>The Sixth Sense</h3>
<p>
    This movie is a 1999 release,and still has the level which even today's movies do not have.The movie is thriller and the suspense based.The movie is based on a child who is able to sight dead people around who all were not visible to others and a child psycologist who helped this child 
    in his problems.
